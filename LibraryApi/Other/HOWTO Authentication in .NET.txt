1. Create User and UserDto class, add corresponding controller, service and repository.
Update Program.cs and DbContext correspondingly.
Create new Users table in SQL Server, don't populate it.

2. Create AuthController, make sure register calls CreateUser and login getUserByUsername.

3. Add Authorize attribute to a controller endpoint. (Here it is DELETE in BookController.)

4. Update Program.cs to enable Authorization header in Swagger. (See commit history for details.)

5. Once you run the app, register first using Swagger auth/register endpoint.
Then log in using those credentials.
Copy the token that was returned.
Go to a book DELETE endpoint and click the lock on the side, write "bearer {JWT}", click close.
DELETE should now work.
